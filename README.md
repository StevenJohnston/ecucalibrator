Me learning everything at the same time with the goal of tuning my car, or blowing it up.

My main goal with this project is to learn both container orchestration (Kubernetes) and CI/CD (Buildkite). There will be many other technologies used here but these 2 I am firm on using. To provide some encouragement I will be attempting to create a system that will help me the process of tunning my car.

Technologies to use:
  - Kubernetes
  - Buildkite
  - Bazel
  - GoLang
  - Cassandra
  - Kong
  - Vue.js Typescript

Other things to learn
  - DNS
  - VPN access
  - sso
  - 2fa

Task's
- Find deployment strategy - Kubernetes objects in yaml, helm, bazel_k8s rule...
- run docker registry in Kubernetes (inception ahead)
